- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodieCoderson but the name is not really accurate. I lack knowledge.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. I know HTML and CSS but realized that JavaScript was more difficult and put it off. I'm determined to grasp its concepts now but could use help from masters on GitHub if you would be so kind.
- 💞️ I’m working on a website for my super-small-business that I wish to grow. I would like to understand how to code things like image carousels, pop-out menu sidebars, form handling etc.. I think it wise to take my time and understand JavaScript as a whole the best I can. What do you think?
- 📫 How to reach me ... Can't you contact me here? See how ignorant I am.
